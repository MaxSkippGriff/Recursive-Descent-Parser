Extension
---------

  My extension consists of:

  - A password manager with encryption and decryption
  
  This can be found at the beginning of the interp.c file.


Password
---------

  After the parser has been executed and before the interpreter
  has been executed, you will be prompted to enter your name
  and password. You will then be shown the name, key and the
  encrypted output of your password. This data is stored in
  the file "oldPass.txt".

  You will have to do this before every new turtle shape.
  I have added a delete function to delete passwords
  after they've been used. This is to avoid the same name
  and password being stored more than once which causes 
  two different encryptions and leads to issues with recovering
  the correct decrypted password.

  Continue this process before each shape and try out different 
  passwords. It's a little bit laborious but that's the nature 
  of the password manager beast.

  NB:- Please don't use special characters - the algorithms for
  performing encryption and decryption only decodes upper/
  lowercase letters and numbers.
